Hey LinkedIn fam! Excited to share the evolution of my chatbot project, Marwin! ðŸ¤–

## Overview

Marwin is an evolving chatbot project that has undergone several phases of development to enhance its capabilities and user experience. Check out the journey from Chatbot 1.0 to Chatbot 3.0!

### Chatbot 1.0 - Simple Q&A

- Accessible from any device, providing a web page-like experience.
- Features an input box for queries and an output box for Marwin's wisdom.
- Responsive and user-friendly.

## Tech Stack
